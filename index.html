                             Painting this was so relaxing and enjoyable and I thought it would be a nice and fun painting to share.</div>

                        <div class="d_p">My father recently decided to sell food plates to make some extra money during quarantine. He came to me and expressed his desire to have a nice flyer and logo to use so that he could spread the news around the neighborhood.
                             I decided to keep the design relatively simple with a basic maroon, white, and black, color scheme with a cute little sausage decal.  
                             Overall, the designs served their purpose and allowed me to try new style types that I may not have experimented  with before.

                        <div class="h_p">I recently purchased a Nintendo Switch and playing games on it has become one of my all time favorite hobbies.
                             My favorite game at the moment is Paper Mario. It is a fun little comedic and action packed video game that features some of Nintendo’s most popular characters. 
                             I really enjoy throwing the confetti and hitting things with Mario’s hammer. I still have a long way to go on this game but my goal is to finish it completely by the end of the year.

                        <div class="h_m">Favorite Music</div>
                        <div class="m_p">   Music is what I often use to fill the quiet voids that are created from being at home and doing online work for long periods of time with minimal human interaction. ChloexHalle’s music has really helped me get in the zone and boost my mood when I get stressed out. 
                            My favorite album of theirs is Ungodly Hour and “Forgive Me” is my favorite song from it at the moment.
                             Another honorable mention is Rina Sawayama who has an album titled Sawayama which is a very close second and my go to study soundtrack.

                       <div class="b_p">My sister has been really interested in creating personalized characters and recently created a miniature version of the two of us hanging out.
                            I wanted to add this as a bonus because I really appreciate the gift she created for me and I thought this would be a very nice way to show my appreciation for her. 
                           Thank you, Devyn!
